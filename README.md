Wosh
====

Wosh is an application that displays project lists to help in a development environment. Unlike Cradiator, Wosh has no memory leak (that we know of). If you discover a memory leak, or a bug for that matter, please contact us!

NOTE: If the above statement did not make sense to you, take a look at the Cradiator application (http://cradiator.codeplex.com/) to get a better idea.
